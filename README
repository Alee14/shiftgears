Shift Gears is a new server for ShiftOS 1.0.

Currently focusing on the available source and binary of 1.0 Beta 2.5.2
but ultimately it would be nice to support as many client versions as
possible.

To run it you need a config.json file that looks something like

```
{
	"dbaddr": "mysql://root:password@localhost/shiftos"
}
```

dependencies: sqlalchemy, twisted, flask, netfleece
You need a WSGI Web server to run unite.wsgi for the Unite server.
You can just execute server.py to run the MUD server.
